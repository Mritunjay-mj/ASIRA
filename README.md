> Intelligent security incident detection and automated response for enterprise environments

## Overview

ASIRA is an advanced security platform that combines anomaly detection and automated incident response to help security teams identify and mitigate threats faster. By leveraging machine learning techniques and predefined response playbooks, ASIRA reduces the time from detection to containment, minimizing the impact of security incidents.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Multi-model machine learning approach to identify security anomalies
  - Statistical analysis (Z-scores, MAD)
  - Isolation Forest algorithm
  - Deep learning with autoencoders
  - Feature importance explanation

- **Automated Response**: Orchestrate security actions through predefined playbooks
  - Account lockdown and identity protection
  - Malware containment and remediation
  - Network segment isolation
  - Custom playbook creation
  
- **Incident Management**: Complete incident lifecycle tracking
  - Incident creation from detections
  - Status tracking and assignments
  - Integration with existing SOC workflows
  - Evidence collection and documentation

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time security posture visualization
  - Incident overview and metrics
  - Detection results and trends
  - System health monitoring
  - Response action tracking

- **API Integration**: Comprehensive REST API for integration with other security tools
  - Authentication and access control
  - Incident and detection endpoints
  - Playbook execution
  - Dashboard metrics
