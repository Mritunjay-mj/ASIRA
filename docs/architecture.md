## System Overview

ASIRA (Automated Security Incident Response Agent) is a cybersecurity platform designed to automate the detection and response to security incidents. The system uses machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in security logs and events, creates incidents for human review, and executes automated response playbooks to contain and remediate threats.

Key capabilities of ASIRA include:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses multiple ML techniques to detect abnormal patterns in security data
- **Automated Response**: Executes predefined security playbooks in response to incidents
- **Incident Management**: Tracks and manages security incidents through their lifecycle
- **Dashboard and Visualization**: Provides real-time visibility into security posture
- **API Integration**: Connects with existing security tools and infrastructure

## Architecture Principles

ASIRA's architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled modules that can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.

2. **Security by Design**: Security controls are built into each component rather than added as an afterthought.

3. **Scalability**: Components are designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load.

4. **Resilience**: The system is designed to continue operating even if some components fail.

5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring are built into all components.

## Component Architecture

ASIRA follows a modular architecture composed of the following key components:

### Detection Module

The detection module is responsible for identifying security anomalies using multiple machine learning techniques.

**Key Components:**
- **Engine**: Core anomaly detection algorithms
- **Processor**: Handles log ingestion and normalization
- **Models**: ML model definitions and training logic

**Detection Methods:**
- Statistical anomaly detection (Z-scores, MAD)
- Isolation Forest
- Autoencoder neural networks

```
src/
  detection/
    __init__.py
    engine.py       # Core detection algorithms
    processor.py    # Log normalization and feature extraction
    models/         # ML model implementations
      __init__.py
```

The detection module uses a multi-model approach that combines results from different detection techniques to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. Features are extracted from normalized logs and fed into the models for training and anomaly detection.

### Response Module

The response module executes automated security responses through playbooks.

**Key Components:**
- **Executor**: Securely runs playbook actions
- **Playbooks**: YAML-defined response procedures
- **Sandbox Manager**: Creates isolated environments for safe execution

**Response Actions:**
- Command execution
- API calls
- Notifications
- Containment actions (network isolation, account lockdown)

```
src/
  response/
    __init__.py
    executor.py     # Playbook execution engine
    playbooks/      # Playbook definitions and base classes
      __init__.py
      base.py       # Base playbook structures
```

Playbooks are defined using YAML and follow a structured format that includes metadata, actions, and execution flow. The executor runs these actions in a sandboxed environment to prevent security issues during remediation.

### API Module

The API module provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the system.

**Key Components:**
- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
- **Models**: Data structures and validation
- **Controllers**: Business logic for API operations

```
src/
  api/
    __init__.py
    routes.py       # API endpoint definitions
    models.py       # Pydantic data models
    controllers.py  # Request handling logic
```

The API is built using FastAPI and provides endpoints for incident management, detection results, playbook execution, and user management.

### Dashboard Module

The dashboard module provides a web interface for security operations.

**Key Components:**
- **App**: Dash application
- **Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and data tables
- **Interactive Controls**: User interface elements

```
src/
  dashboard/
    __init__.py
    app.py          # Dashboard web application
```

The dashboard provides real-time visibility into security incidents, detection results, and system health.

### Common Module

The common module provides shared functionality used across other components.

**Key Components:**
- **Config**: Configuration management
- **Database**: Database connections and utilities
- **Logging**: Logging configuration
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization

```
src/
  common/
    __init__.py
    config.py       # Configuration management
    database.py     # Database connections
    logging_config.py # Logging setup
    security.py     # Authentication and authorization
```

## Data Flow

The ASIRA system data flow follows these key paths:

1. **Detection Flow**:
   - Security logs and events are collected from various sources
   - Data is normalized into a common format
   - Features are extracted for anomaly detection
   - Multiple ML models analyze the data for anomalies
   - Detected anomalies are stored and can trigger incidents

2. **Response Flow**:
   - Security incidents are created (manually or automatically)
   - Appropriate playbooks are selected based on incident type
   - Playbook executor runs actions in a sandboxed environment
   - Action results are recorded and linked to the incident
   - Incidents are updated with response status

3. **Visualization Flow**:
   - Dashboard queries API for incident and detection data
   - Data is transformed for visualization
   - Users interact with dashboard to manage incidents
   - API sends commands back to core components

## Deployment Architecture

ASIRA can be deployed in the following configurations:

### Single-Server Deployment

For small environments, all components can run on a single server:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│               ASIRA Server          │
├─────────┬───────────┬───────────────┤
│ API &   │ Detection │ PostgreSQL    │
│ Dashboard│ Engine    │ Redis        │
├─────────┼───────────┤               │
│ Response │ Playbook  │               │
│ Executor │ Registry  │               │
└─────────┴───────────┴───────────────┘
```

### Distributed Deployment

For larger environments, components can be distributed across multiple servers:

```
┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐

                                └────────────┘
```

### Containerized Deployment

ASIRA can also be deployed using containers:

```
